Many tips of succeeding on creating a web application for startups on the very early age.

It inspired me a lot.

## Quotes

> Do less than your competitors to beat them

Having a lot of features is not always the value of the product. Doing less and making it simple can be great value.

> Scope down. It's better to make half a product than a half-asses product.

You should keep time and budget fixed, and just scale back the scope. With the same scope quality often suffers.

> Keep it small. Keep it simple. Let it happen.

> For the 0rst version of your app, start with only three people. That's the magic number that will give you enough man power.

Wearing many hats is okay. 

> It's a Problem When it's a problem.

Don't waste time on problems you don't have yet. No one still use your app, and you don't know yet, so don't spend so much time about scalability. Don't overbuild it.

Paid features can be after the release.

> idea are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.

> Design the interface before you start programming

Paper is cheap and fast.
Programming is the most time consuming tasks, so do less as possible.

> Start from the core of the page.

If the core feature doesn't work, or is impossible to do the service is useless. Login feature can be done later though it's mandatory.

> Three State Solutions

1. Regular
2. **Blank**
3. **Error**

The blank state is very important. It's what they see for the initial user which you want to keep them. Show them some tutorial, explain how to use and hel0p reduce frustrations.

> Defensive Design for the Web

Seems to be a good book for developers as well for designing error state.

> There's Nothing Functional about a Functional Spec

Don't write. 

> The difference between you and everyone else will be how well you execute. Success is all about great execution.

Yes sir.
