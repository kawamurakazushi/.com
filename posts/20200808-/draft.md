I wanted to write about what I learned during being an interviewee, and actually doing some interview with some startups.

And I get to realize what are some tips to increase these possibility of winning this game.

Though these all depends which company you are applying to, and who will be the interviewee, it's just what I think with my small experience being in both side.



<!-- How to increase the probability of winning the interview

1
Use referral
If I was the interview guy if it was someone from a smart employee it’s much easier for the company to pass
So it you have a friend working in the company you want to go you should use that connection

2
Don’t use an agent
Using an agent is a big cost for the company
Normally if you hire one engineer the agent will take about twenty to thirty percent if you’re salary
Which is a lot if you think of a salary from an engineer
But if you apply directly from the company’s website the company will not need to think about The cost, which may increase the chance of getting in the company
And more chance of negotiating for a higher salary

3
Apply one by one.
Don’t use an agent and apply thousands of company at once. Yes it might increase the chance of getting a job but that’s the power of numbers but it is harder to get your ideally job

Read the company vision and spend time

5
If you are new to the industry or technology that’s a chance
Research and study a bout theses things and if you are an engineer implement some modules library or a project and show them what you have done during the interview process

This is not to shows off your super programming skills
It is to show you are really wanting this position and willing to learn new things in the company and you can do that in a short period of time -->
