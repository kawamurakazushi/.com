## Introduction

I have came across many window manager, using from ShiftIt, Spectacle, Rectangle, slatejs, yabai, and more, but so far Hammerspoon has been the best, in terms of speed, and flexibility.

I would like to introduce my Hammerspoon's current configuration.

## What can it do.

This is the list what it can do.

1. Resize Windows
1. Switch Applications
1. Show Dates and Battery Information

## How

Hammerspoon configuration uses a programming language called lua. It's not a difficult language, and you don't have to master the language to write the configuration.

### 1. Resizing window

This is the functions of resizing the windows.

It basically gets the currently focused `window`, and set the `frame` (size of the window) by using the `screen`'s frame, which is the size of your screen (or monitor).

```lua
local resizeFull = function()
  local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
  local f = win:frame()
  local screen = win:screen()
  local max = screen:frame()

  f.x = 0
  f.y = 0
  f.w = max.w
  f.h = max.h
  win:setFrame(f, 0)
end

local resizeLeft = function()
  local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
  local f = win:frame()
  local screen = win:screen()
  local max = screen:frame()

  f.x = 0
  f.y = 0
  f.w = max.w / 2
  f.h = max.h
  win:setFrame(f, 0)
end

local resizeRight = function()
  local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
  local f = win:frame()
  local screen = win:screen()
  local max = screen:frame()

  f.x = max.x + (max.w / 2)
  f.y = max.y
  f.w = max.w / 2
  f.h = max.h
  win:setFrame(f, 0)
end

local resizeTop = function()
  local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
  local f = win:frame()
  local screen = win:screen()
  local max = screen:frame()

  f.x = 0
  f.y = 0
  f.w = max.w
  f.h = max.h / 2
  win:setFrame(f, 0)
end

local resizeBottom = function()
  local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
  local f = win:frame()
  local screen = win:screen()
  local max = screen:frame()
  f.x = 0
  f.y = max.h / 2
  f.w = max.w
  f.h = max.h / 2
  win:setFrame(f, 0)
end
```

These are just functions, so you want to bind it with a specific key combination. You do it by the `hs.hotkey.bind()` function, that hammerspoon provides.

```lua
local mash = { "alt" }

hs.hotkey.bind(mash, "h", resizeLeft)
hs.hotkey.bind(mash, "j", resizeBottom)
hs.hotkey.bind(mash, "k", resizeTop)
hs.hotkey.bind(mash, "l",  resizeRight)
hs.hotkey.bind(mash, "f", resizeFull)
```

So in this configuration, if you press `alt+f` the current window will turn full screen.

`mash` can be any modifier key. I'm mapping the _right shift_ to _alt_, so I'm actually pressing `right shift + f` for making the window full screen.

You can map specific key to other key by using [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).

### 2. Switch Applications

Normally, applications you use in your daily basis is the same.
So I wanted to map a specific key to launch or focus the application, so I can graduate from repeated `cmd+tab`s.

This is super easy, since hammerspoon provides a wonderful function called `hs.application.launchOrFocus()` which is what I wanted to do.

```lua
local apps = {
  { key = "w", app = "google chrome" },
  { key = "q", app = "notion" },
  { key = "e", app = "slack" }
}

for i, object in ipairs(apps) do
  hs.hotkey.bind(mash, object.key, function()
    hs.application.launchOrFocus(object.app)
  end)
end
```

ðŸŽ‰ Nice and Simple.

But for my developing environment I wanted to do something different and not just focusing the application but also resizing the window depending on the current situation.

I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) for my terminal, and VSCode as an editor.

I wanted something _tmux like_ experience switching between the terminal and my editor.
And this is my current solution, but I'm still seeking for a better solution.

```lua
local hyper = "co.zeit.hyper"
local vscode = "com.microsoft.VSCode"

local dev = {
  { key = "a", bundleID = hyper },
  { key = "d", bundleID = vscode}
}

for i, object in ipairs(dev) do
  hs.hotkey.bind(mash, object.key, function()
    local bundleID = object.bundleID
    local beforeBundleId = hs.window.focusedWindow():application():bundleID();

    hs.application.launchOrFocusByBundleID(bundleID)
    local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()

    local frame = win:frame()
    local max = win:screen():frame()
    local isFull = frame.w == max.w and frame.h == max.h

    local isSame = beforeBundleId == bundleID

    if(isFull and isSame) then
      if(bundleID == hyper) then
        resizeLeft()
      elseif(bundleID == vscode) then
        resizeRight()
      end
    else
      if(isSame) then
        resizeFull()
      end
    end
  end)
end
```

What this does is, if I press `alt+a` from a application that is not Hyper, it will focus Hyper.

But it you are already focused on Hyper, it will resize depending on the current screen size.

- If Hyper is full screen, it will resize on the left half on the screen.
- If Hyper is not full screen, it will rezize to full screen.

Basically if you keep on pressing `alt+a`, it will toggle from resizing from full screen to left half of your screen.

It does the same thing for VSCode but it will toggle from full screen to _right_ half of your screen.
This will help me quickly jump between the editor and terminal but also, making full screen when I need to easy more easier than, reaching to another key.

Some time I want to see both terminal and my editor side by side immediately. I made this configuration to accomplish this.

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(mash, "s", function()
  local currentBundleID = hs.window.focusedWindow():application():bundleID()
  if(currentBundleID == hyper) then
    resizeLeft()
    hs.application.launchOrFocusByBundleID(vscode)
    resizeRight()
  elseif(currentBundleID == vscode) then
    resizeRight()
    hs.application.launchOrFocusByBundleID(hyper)
    resizeLeft()
  else
    hs.application.launchOrFocusByBundleID(vscode)
    resizeRight()
    hs.application.launchOrFocusByBundleID(hyper)
    resizeLeft()
  end
end)
```

This will nicely split the terminal and editor, and focus on one of them depending on the situation.

### 3. Show Dates and Battery Information

This is the simplest, but my favorite configuration.

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind(mash, ';', function()
  local chargingMark = hs.battery.isCharging() and " *" or ""
  local battery =  hs.battery.percentage() .. "%" .. chargingMark
  hs.alert.show(os.date("%a %b %d - %H:%M | ") .. battery, 4)
end)
```

It will show an alert of the current date time, and the battery information.

Why is this so useful? It's because I hide the menu bar of the mac, so in order to check the time or the battery, I needed to move my mouse to the top to check.

But if you have this command I can check it with a simple key bind.

## Summary

The best part of Hammerspoon is the **speed**, and the **flexibility**.

Window tiling manager like ShiftIt, Spectacle, and Rectangle are fast, but not enough flexibility.

And application like [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) + [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), and [slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) are super flexible, but not fast enough.

Overall In my current opinion Hammerspoon, is the most well balanced application, and fitted my needs.
