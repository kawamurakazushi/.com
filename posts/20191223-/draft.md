1. Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming along with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and functional programming. JavaScript supports OOP with prototypal inheritance.
Good to hear:
Prototypal inheritance (also: prototypes, OLOO).
Functional programming (also: closures, first class functions, lambdas).
Red flags:
No clue what a paradigm is, no mention of prototypal oo or functional programming.
